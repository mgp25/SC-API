If you're receiving a "BadAuthentication" error when getting the authentication from Google's servers, follow these steps:

1) When signed in to your Google account, visit this page and click "Unlock": https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
2) Enable 2-step verification
3) Generate a new App Password for "other" at this page: https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords
4) Use that password for the Gmail password when setting up Snap-API.

Enjoy!
