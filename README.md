### Installation

```sh
composer require mgp25/snapapi
```

## Getting a Casper API Key

This is required for the API to work.

Go to https://clients.casper.io/login.php and create an account.

Once you have created an account, go to `Projects` and create a new project.

Now you will have your project with your API Key and API Secret.

You will need to set this data in the constructor, as shown in the [examples] (/examples).
